Pact Pool
=========

This app is used to pool money with friends to encourage successful completion of a recurring pact.
For example, you might each chip in $1 every week to encourage going to the gym.
If someone doesn't go to the gym, everyone who did go to the gym splits the pot.
If everyone goes to the gym, the pool rolls over to next week.


Goals
-----

* Create an app that meets our own needs.
* Push the bounds of our Ruby experience.
* See if we can turn this into a service.
